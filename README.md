## Directions 
Write a program in Go that generates n weeks of random temperature data (one temperature for each day of the week), calculates the average temperature for each week, and
then sorts the average temperatures for each week from highest to lowest (with correct labels for the week number that each average temperature belongs to). You should use
Go routines to generate the data for each week simulataneously and then calculate the average for each week simulatneously. 

The program should be able to generate, calculate the average of, and finally sort the averages of any number of weeks (n). 

## Submission
Just a .go file with your code.
